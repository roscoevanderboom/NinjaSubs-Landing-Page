# NinjaSubs-Landing-Page

NinjaSubs is a service that was developed to help schools and teachers to quickly connect depending on the city and district they are located in. 

<h3>User Features:</h3>

For Employers:
* create user profile ( image, name, contact person, address, district, phone number )
* create up to 4 job posts ( dates, rates, description ) 
* view candidates that applied to job post
* view substitutes available in the school's district
* start a private chat with a substitute
* block users

For Substitutes:
* create user profile ( name, image, introduction )
* set availability status
* tag districts that you are available in ( this filters the noticeboard, to only show relevant posts )
* apply to / ignore job posts
* view substitutes available the same districts
* start a private chat with other substitutes
* block users

<h3>For developers:</h3>
This project was made using React, MaterialUI and Firebase. It's free and open to other developers to make pull requests and redesign elements. It could also service as a template for other Firebase projects. Just replace the API details with those of your own project.

I create a new Firebase database for each city that NinjaSubs covers.
